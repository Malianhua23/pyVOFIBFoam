# pyVOFIBFoam
A fullly resolved three-dimensional VOF-DEM coupling solver.

**Key Advantages:**
* True fully resolved coupling between fluid and particles.
* Handle simple spherical particles with the functionality of PFC3D.
* Efficient parallel computing with OPENFOAM and PFC3D. Currently only serial is supported, a parallel version is under development.
* Seamless integration between the two software packages.
* Supports a wide range of physical models from PFC3D.
* Highly customizable and extensible due to OPENFOAM's open-source nature.

**attention:**
The research paper of the solver is under review, and only partial validation cases have been uploaded.

After the manuscript is accepted, the program developed in this work (pyVOFIBFoam) will be freely accessed, and the link will be updated in this section of the proof version.

The software package is now being prepared and will be released soon.
